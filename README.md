# Cubing
My experiences with cubing
<br>
In general my experiences with cubing are very positive yes I only managed to solve the pyraminx but for someone who had no previous
experience I feel like that is a huge achivement. I was skeptical about what this would teach me but it taught me alot about taking my time and looking at the situation from multiple angles. Also about algorothms, at first i tought that you spin it and slove the cube but then I relised that there is an order of operations like in math and algorithms that can help you get to the end goal. here are the times i got after a week and a few days of practice, I feel like i reached a goal that I never would have otherwise.

trial 1: 24.430 seconds<br>
trial 2: 11.620 seconds<br>
trial 3: 10.120 seconds<br>
trial 4: 12.360 seconds<br>
trial 5: 12.230 seconds<br>

middle 3 average:12.070 seconds

I feel like this is a very good time for a first time cuber, I found this experiance to be very fun and i would like to apply my self again to a diffrent type of cube in the future.
